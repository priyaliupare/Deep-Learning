# Support_Vector_machine

Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. Deleting the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane. These are the points that help us build our SVM


# Support vector machine example

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm capable of performing classification, regression and even outlier detection. The linear SVM classifier works by drawing a straight line between two classes.
